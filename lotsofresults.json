Downsize wallets and purses. Before your crew or krewe heads out, switch to a thin-profile wallet with only essentials such as a photo i.d., limited cash and a debit or credit card with fraud alert benefits.",

            "description": "Of course, the best way to avoid overdrafts and fees is to keep track of your expenditures so you wonâ€™t spend more money than you have. But with all the different ways to spend money these days â€“ ATMs, debit cards, automatic payments deducted from your checking account â€“ itâ€™s understandable... to be processed that would have otherwise been returned unpaid. While we can pay your checks and other electronic items into overdraft at our discretion, you must opt-in to our Standard Overdraft Services if you want us to consider authorizing and paying your ATM and everyday debit card transactions into overdraft; otherwise those transactions will generally be declined when there are insufficient funds in your account.",

Your bank account or card information is linked to mobile wallet and securely stored on your device.... In many ways, mobile wallet is safer than carrying cards. When you make a mobile wallet payment, a unique code is sent to the payment terminal instead of your card details. And since most phones canâ€™t be operated without a fingerprint ID or personal identification number, getting card information off your phone is more difficult than opening a wallet."

If your checks have been stolen or misused, stop payment on any outstanding checks. Also contact the major check verification companies to request that they notify retailers using their databases not to accept these checks, or ask your bank to notify the appropriate check verification service:... If an identity thief has established new phone service in your name or is making unauthorized calls using your phone number, calling card number and PIN, contact your service provider to cancel the account.",

But with all the different ways to spend money these days â€“ ATMs, debit cards, automatic payments deducted from your checking account â€“ itâ€™s understandable... to be processed that would have otherwise been returned unpaid. While we can pay your checks and other electronic items into overdraft at our discretion, you must opt-in to our Standard Overdraft Services if you want us to consider authorizing and paying your ATM and everyday debit card transactions into overdraft; otherwise those transactions will generally be declined when there are insufficient funds in your account.",
